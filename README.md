**automat**.ino is a JSON-RPC API wrapper for Arduino's [Mouse and Keyboard libraries](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/MouseKeyboard). It allows the mouse and keyboard functions to be invoked remotely from a PC over a serial port, effectively allowing a programmer to use an Arduino as a programmable hardware mouse and keyboard.

This library was written with the intention of being used to write video game bots that have lower probabilities of being detected by anti-cheat systems. Video games may use monitoring tools to inspect all processes running in a machine to detect the use of software macroing. Since the mouse and keyboard libraries allow an Arduino to appear as a native mouse or keyboard, this detection avenue is bypassed.

Only Arduino boards that have Mouse and Keyboard library support can be used. This includes the Leonardo, Micro, Due, and Zero boards as well as any other 32u4 based boards.

# Requirements

- A compatible Arduino board
- [Arduino IDE 1.6.x or later](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
- Microsoft Windows

# Dependencies

- [arduino-json-rpc](https://github.com/cloud-rocket/arduino-json-rpc) (included)
- [Boost C++ Libraries](http://www.boost.org/)

# Building

The **automat**.ino client code is built as a static library (`.lib`) that is to be linked into your C++ project.

1. Install Visual Studio 2017 (with the Visual C++ toolset and Windows 10 SDK modules).
2. Open the Visual Studio project file (`automat.vcxproj`) in Visual Studio 2017.
3. Configure `Project Properties` to use the correct Windows 10 SDK version.
4. Configure `Project Properties` to specify the Boost include and library paths.
5. Compile the static library: `Build` → `Build Solution`.

# Setup

1. Download the latest **automat**.ino release [here](https://github.com/nuttywhal/automat.ino/releases) and un-zip.
2. Connect the Arduino board to the computer via a USB connection.
3. In the Arduino IDE, add the *arduino-json-rpc* dependency to the Library Manager.
   - `Sketch` → `Include Library` → `Add .ZIP Library...` → `arduino/json-rpc.zip`.
4. Open `automat.ino` located in `arduino/` and upload the sketch (<kbd>CTRL + U</kbd>).

Once the Arduino sketch has been uploaded, the Arduino board is ready to respond to remote procedure call requests from the computer. **automat**.ino provides a C++ API that enables making those requests. To use it, add the `include/` and `lib/` directories to your project's include and linker library paths.

Make sure to disable mouse acceleration (A.K.A. pointer precision) under the Windows Mouse settings. Having mouse acceleration enabled may make the mouse functions in this API work incorrectly.

# Usage

Include the `Automat.h` header file in your project, then create an instance of the `automat::Automat` class by passing the name of the serial (COM) port that the Arduino is connected to as an argument to the constructor. The entire API is available through class methods.

```C++
#include <Automat.h>

/**
 * Moves the mouse cursor to the top-left of the screen,
 * waits 2 seconds, then moves the mouse cursor to the
 * bottom-right of the screen.
 */
void script(void)
{
    // Dimensions of the screen.
    const int WIDTH = 1920;
    const int HEIGHT = 1080;

    // Setup the Automat client.
    automat::Automat automat("COM4");
    automat.calibrate();

    // Write your script here.
    automat.wind_mouse(0, 0);
    automat.sleep(2000);
    automat.wind_mouse(WIDTH, HEIGHT);
}
```

# API Reference

**Note**: All methods marked with ​:cyclone:​ provide additional anti-cheat system detection prevention by either humanizing mouse movements and keyboard inputs and/or adding random delays.

## Mouse Methods

[#]() `Automat::calibrate()`

Invoke this function to calibrate your mouse sensitivity settings with the Arduino board to determine a calibration factor used to map the units used internally by Arduino's [`Mouse.move()`](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/MouseMove) function to pixel units. This function is what enables this API to achieve absolute positioning. **Invoke this function before invoking any other mouse functions.**

[#]() `Automat::move(x, y)`

Snaps the mouse cursor to the specified location.

- **x**: x-coordinate of destination location - `unsigned int`
- **y**: y-coordinate of destination location - `unsigned int`

[#]() `Automat::linear_move(x, y)`

Moves the mouse cursor to the specified location along a linear path.

- **x**: x-coordinate of destination location - `unsigned int`
- **y**: y-coordinate of destination location - `unsigned int`

[#]() `Automat::wind_move(x, y, gravity, wind, minWait, maxWait, maxStep, targetArea)` :cyclone:

Moves the mouse cursor to the specified location along randomly-generated spline defined by the `gravity` and `wind` parameters. This algorithm was designed by BenLand100 & Flight and ported from the [SRL Resource Library](https://github.com/SRL/SRL).

- **x**: x-coordinate of destination location - `unsigned int`
- **y**: y-coordinate of destination location - `unsigned int`
- **gravity** = `2.0`: A factor that keeps the mouse cursor along a linear path to the destination - `double`
- **wind** = `2.0`: A factor that causes the mouse cursor to waver away from the path to the destination - `double`
- **minWait** = `2.0`: Minimum time (in milliseconds) to wait before each step - `double`
- **maxWait** = `10.0`: Maximum time (in milliseconds) to wait before each step - `double`
- **maxStep** = `20.0`: Maximum distance (in pixels) to move in each step - `double`
- **targetArea** = `50.0`: Radius of destination location to reach before homing into destination - `double`

[#]() `Automat::click(button)` :cyclone:

Sends a momentary click to the computer, holding the mouse button down for a random interval between 10-50ms before releasing.

- **button** = `automat::M_LEFT`: Mouse button to click - `Button`

[#]() `Automat::double_click(button)` :cyclone:

Sends a double-click action to the computer—equivalent to calling `Automat::click(button)` twice.

- **button** = `automat::M_LEFT`: Mouse button to click - `Button`

[#]() `Automat::hold(button)`

Sends a button press to the computer. This will click and continuously hold the mouse button. A press is cancelled with `Automat::unhold(button)`.

- **button** = `automat::M_LEFT`: Mouse button to click - `Button`


[#]() `Automat::unhold(button)`

Sends a button release message to the computer. This will release a button press made by `Automat::hold(button)`.

- **button** = `automat::M_LEFT`: Mouse button to click - `Button`

## Keyboard Methods

[#]() `Automat::write(key)`

Sends a keystroke to the computer.

**key**: Keyboard button to press - `Key`

[#]() `Automat::tap(key)` :cyclone:

Sends a keystroke to the computer, holding the key down for a random interval between 10-50ms before releasing.

- **key**: Keyboard button to press - `Key`

[#]() `Automat::press(key)`

Press and hold a key as if it were pressed and held on your keyboard. This is useful when using modifier keys. A key is released with `Automat::release(key)` or `Automat::releaseAll()`.

- **key**: Keyboard button to press - `Key`

[#]() `Automat::release(key)`

Releases the specified key held down by `Automat::press(key)`.

- **key**: Keyboard button to press - `Key`

[#]() `Automat::releaseAll()`

Releases all keys held down by `Automat::press(key)`.

[#]() `Automat::print(message)`

Types a message string. The string is sent as a single keystroke.

- **message**: A message to type - `std::string`

[#]() `Automat::println(message)`

Types a message string followed by a newline character and a carriage return. The string is sent as a single keystroke.

- **message**: A message to type - `std::string`

[#]() `Automat::type(message)` :cyclone:

Types a message like a human. This function attempts to emulate human typing by occasionally making mistakes and amending them with the backspace key.

- **message**: A message to type - `std::string`
- **wpm** = `100`: Rate (words per minute) to type the message (assuming five characters per word) - `unsigned int`
- **mistakes** = `true`: If true, typing mistakes will be made by the library and amended - `bool`
- **accuracy** = `98`: Probability of making a mistake when typing each character in the message - `unsigned int`
